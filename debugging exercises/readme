# ROS 2 Palindrome Service – Debugging Exercise

This repository contains a **ROS 2 (Humble, Python) service-based application** that was used as a **debugging test** as part of my **PG Diploma coursework**.

The objective of this exercise was not just to run the code, but to **identify, analyze, and correct multiple errors** present across different components of a ROS 2 system.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

The application checks whether a given string is a **palindrome** using a **ROS 2 service**.

However, the provided implementation contained multiple intentional errors in:
- Service server logic
- Client execution flow
- Launch configuration
- Python packaging (`setup.py`)
- Overall ROS 2 architecture

---

## 🧩 System Architecture

- **Interface Package**
  - Defines the custom `.srv` file (`CheckPalindrome.srv`)
- **Service Package**
  - Server node: processes palindrome logic
  - Client node: sends request and displays response
  - Launch file: runs server and client together

---

## 🐞 Errors Identified

Some of the key issues identified during debugging include:

- Service name mismatch between client and server
- Incorrect string reversal logic for palindrome checking
- Missing return statement in service callback
- Client node shutting down before receiving response
- Launch file not installed properly
- Missing imports and syntax errors in `setup.py`
- Lack of separation between interface and implementation packages

---

## ✅ Corrections Applied

- Fixed service name consistency
- Corrected palindrome checking logic
- Ensured proper request–response handling
- Added client spinning for service completion
- Properly installed launch files via `setup.py`
- Corrected Python packaging errors
- Refactored architecture to follow ROS 2 best practices
